    <h1 class="originh">Cesium Uses</h1>
    <p class="originp">
    Cesium is used in the cesium clock, the world's time standard. Some of these clocks can be reliable to 1 second in 15,000,000 years, and are about as big as a train car. The reliability and high frequency of cesium's microwaves allow for this precision.  <br> <br>
    It's also used in medical and industrial radiology, because of its 30.17 year half-life. <br> <br>
    As well, it's commonly used in compounds as drilling fluid - a mixture that carries rock to the surface and lubricates and cools the drill bit. Cesium's low environmental toxicity and biodegradablity make it a good choice for this. <br> <br>
