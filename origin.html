    <p class="originp">
        Cesium was discovered by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860. <br> <br>
        It was discovered using flame spectroscopy, and was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically. <br> <br>
        It was discovered in Heidelberg, Germany. <br> <br>
        Its name comes from the Latin word <i>caesius</i>, meaning sky blue, named for the blue lines of its spectrum. <br> <br>
        Cesium was almost discovered in 1846 by Carl Plattner when he was examining pollucite, but he ran out of material before he could figure it out.
